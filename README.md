# Enhancing Object Detection with YOLOv5: A Deep Dive into Tanganika Dataset Analysis
I am a dedicated Master of Computer Science candidate, deeply immersed in a research journey that delves into the fascinating realm of object detection in marine environments. Collaborating with the South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity (SAIAB), my research focuses on assessing the effectiveness of two leading deep learning models, YOLOv5 and YOLOv8, across a diverse range of marine datasets.

This profound investigation aims to shed light on the comparative strengths and capabilities of these state-of-the-art object detection algorithms within the context of marine life. At the heart of this research lies the Tanganika Dataset, generously provided by SAIAB, which poses intricate challenges in the field of computer vision.

By meticulously evaluating the performance of YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 on this dataset and others, I aspire to contribute valuable insights to the computer science community, particularly in the domain of marine object detection.

This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive record of the research, findings, and codebase developed throughout my master's thesis project. I wholeheartedly welcome collaborators, fellow researchers, and enthusiasts to join me in this scholarly endeavor, providing a window into the world of object detection in aquatic environments and the capabilities of YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 in addressing these challenges.
